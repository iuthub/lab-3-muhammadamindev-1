    <p>Yesterday i went to the store and some much-needed spatulas.

        My favourite cartoon character is Cookie Monster, and my favourite desert is Cupkaes, so Cookie Monster
        cupkaes are the best of both worlds.

        Did you know? Cookie Monster once said, "Sometimes, me think what is love, and then me think love is,
        what last cookie is for. Me give up the last cookie for you."I wonder if the same applies for cupcakes?
        (If so, i don't think i can ever love ANYONE!)
